[center][size=12pt][u][b]Installation[/b][/u][/size][/center]

The Statistics Tab mod installs through the package manager. It only edits one file, aswell as the language file(s), so nothing should go wrong in the installation. If anything does go wrong, use a [i]package parser[/i] and install it manually, it's not that hard.
